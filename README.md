#### The code includes the _Theictionaryroj2013.exe_ file for running a specially devised tool for structuring the database needed for training a Deep Artificial Network for structuring SpatialNet, which is a knowledge graph (KG). _Theictionaryroj2013.exe_ can be found at (.\Theictionaryroj2013\Theictionaryroj2013\bin\Debug, the online path is  https://github.com/SpatialNet-Final/SpatialNet-v0.0/tree/master/Theictionaryroj2013/bin/Debug)

#### To use the .exe file and to structure  your own version of SpatialNet:
- you need to upload  seven specially formatted DHF5 file of seven corpora to  (_.\Theictionaryroj2013\Theictionaryroj2013\bin\Debug\ConceptNet_)
- The seven corpora are downloadable from (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t9rjmejcmminwwj/AAB5TT3fLklKkbU3D5rJajgSa?dl=0)
- You need to be connected online to use the ConceptNet tab.
- to use the WordNet tab you need to upload the wordnet files at (_.\Theictionaryroj2013\Theictionaryroj2013\bin\Debug\wordnet_). A compressed tar file of the WordNet 3.1 database files is downloadable from https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/current-version. you need to uncompress the files into the aforementioned _\Debug\wordnet_ path.
